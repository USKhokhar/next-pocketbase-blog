            <p>Being an art enthusiast, I crave for creative explorations. I regularly sail my voyages in the vast oceans of ingenuity. As a result of which, I’m a guy who can design webpages for you. After designing your pages, you don’t need to look for a nerdy developer out there to build that page. I’m quite a narcissict when it comes to my work, so why would I give my design to other guy for developement. Considering all of that, I’m a front-end developer who can make your own website go live on the interenet. But what about the content you are going to showcase on your website... don’t worry, I got you covered. Your little man over here is an avid reader and occasional writer.</p>
            <p>So basically, I’ve got what it takes to give you all that you need!</p>
            <p>See you on the other side, mate!</p>
