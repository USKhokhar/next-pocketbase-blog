# Mentions

Being fairly new to the BaaS thing and being someone who has mostly worked on the client side, this project was not easy. Also, (I'm not sure) but I think I'm one of the first people to use PocketBase and NextJs in such project. Almost all blog projects I saw made using NextJs used MDX. 

The biggest problem I faced was in the deployment of pocketbase, to which I'm extremely thankful to the PocketBase team. To all the responses they gave on Twitter and on GitHub Discussions.
